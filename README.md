## Why your UI and UX implementation and code implementation is the best.

- UI and UX:
    - I developed the UI with the mentality of `simplicity is beauty`.
    - I made sure that the UX is user friendly.
    - I used `earth colors` since it is a weather app to incorporate it to nature.
    - I displayed all the important informations that I was able to retrieve from the provided API.
    - I added enough labels for each information displayed so that the user can easily understand it.
    - I added icons to display the current weather of the selected place.
    - I made sure that the design is responsive so it will not break no matter what the screen size is.

- Code Implementation
    - I developed the code using the MVC structure for both the frontend and backend side.
    - I followed the SOLID principle to the best of my ability.
    - I checked all possible issues that may occur and added enough validation to avoid system errors.
    - I implemented that the code should be easy to understand and can be maintained by other developers.
    - I made sure to use the laravel helpers so that the code runs smoothly.
    - I made sure to implement the changes to be as efficient and clean as I possibly can.
    - I made sure that the functionalities work as intended and followed the specifications provided in the document.
